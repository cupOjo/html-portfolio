<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Jordan Stewart! I work at Costco as a Buyer and have been with the
  company for 12 years. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong understanding of
  supply chain management, vendor relations, and market trends. My career goal
  is to become a Lead Buyer and take on more responsibility in shaping Costco’s
  product offerings. At the same time, I’m dedicated to supporting my wife in
  her career journey—she’s the breadwinner in our family and an inspiration to
  me every day.

  Outside of work, I’m a huge fan of basketball, football, cars, and investing.
  My favorite basketball team is the Seattle Sonics, and though they’re no
  longer active, I’m a loyal fan and always keep an eye on the NBA. As for
  football, I enjoy watching the games but haven’t settled on a favorite team
  yet. When it comes to cars, I’m fascinated by the engineering and design
  behind different models and love attending car shows whenever I get the
  chance.

  One of my biggest passions is investing, particularly in cryptocurrency. I’m
  especially excited about the Internet Computer, a blockchain platform that I
  believe is going to change the world. Its ability to integrate blockchain
  directly into the internet stack and its vision for decentralized apps (dApps)
  truly inspire me. Exploring the innovative potential of the Internet Computer
  has become one of my favorite pastimes, and I’m constantly learning about its
  latest developments.

  In my downtime, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, going on road
  trips, and trying out new restaurants. I also make it a point to give back to
  the community by volunteering at local food drives and mentoring young
  professionals looking to enter the retail industry. Personal growth is
  important to me, and I’m always looking for ways to learn new skills, whether
  it’s through online courses or simply picking up a new hobby.
</p>

<p>
  Looking ahead, I’m excited about the future. I’m working towards achieving my
  professional goals, building a secure financial future, and creating
  meaningful experiences with my loved ones. Whether it’s advancing my career at
  Costco, exploring new investment opportunities like the Internet Computer, or
  just enjoying a quiet weekend at home, I’m committed to living a balanced and
  purposeful life.
